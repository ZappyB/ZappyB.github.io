                PhoneGap (or PhoneGap Build or Cordova): This hybrid framework allows 
                developers to build mobile apps using web technologies like HTML, CSS, 
                and JavaScript. It provides access to native APIs and has a strong 
                community base. PhoneGap is a reliable choice for cross-platform development, 
                offering flexibility and robust backend support.

                Developed by Google, Flutter is an open-source framework that enables 
                developers to build natively compiled applications for mobile, web, and 
                desktop from a single codebase. It uses the Dart programming language 
                and is known for its high performance, hot reload feature, and ready-made 
                widgets for fast UI coding.

            <h2>React Native</h2>
            <p>
                This framework, developed by Facebook, allows developers to build native 
                mobile applications using JavaScript and React libraries. It's a popular 
                choice among developers, offering low development time, support for 
                third-party libraries, and a responsive UI/UX. React Native is UI-focused 
                and allows for the incorporation of functionality from other native apps.
