                        Hi, My name is Mark, I'm from the Philippines and I've
                        been here at CSM for about a year now. I just moved here
                        to the country like 2 years ago so I feel like I have
                        adjusted maybe a little, still missing some of my peeps
                        back home. Right now I am working as a fast food employee
                        part time, and for my free time I would like to watch animes,
                        play games and code just for fun. For my aspirations, I 
                        aspire to be someone able to make programs that will help
                        people from their day to day lives.
                     </p>

        </table>

    <p>
        I am attending this class because if I ever wanna make
        a well functioning website, available for everyone to use,
        I also have to learn how to effeciently run it on not just 
        Mac or Windows. I want it also to function and do well in
        a Smartphone.
